            "title": "LeetCode 11 - Container with Most Water",
            "content": "Introduction . Problem Statement . You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). . Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. . Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. . Example: . . Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49 Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49. . Foreword . The brute force solution to this problem consists of checking each pair of vertical lines. Since order of any given pair does not matter, this solution has time complexity $O({n choose 2}) = O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the length of the height array. . The non-brute-force solution to this problem (i.e. the &#39;two pointer solution&#39;) is pretty intuitive - the difficulty lies in its proof of correctness. Therefore, I will give away the procedure in this foreword and then proceed to prove its correctness. . Here&#39;s the procedure: . Initialize left and right pointers at 1 and n respectively (assuming indices start at 1). | While the pointers do not intersect: Fix the pointer whose corresponding vertical line is longer. | Advance the pointer whose corresponding vertical line is shorter towards the fixed one. | . | class Solution: def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -&gt; int: n = len(height) lpt, rpt = 0, n-1 max_volume = 0 while lpt &lt; rpt: shorter = min(lpt, rpt) max_volume = max(max_volume, min(lpt, rpt) * (lpt - rpt + 1)) . . Optimal Substructure . The procedure is inspired by the following optimal substructure of the problem: . Let $h(i)$ denote the height of the $i$-th vertical line. . Let $a(i,j)$ denote the area of the container formed by the pair of vertical lines $(i,j)$. . Let $maxArea([i:j])$ denote the maximum area formed by the lines $i,...,j$ – that is the output of the procedure on the subarray $[i,j]$. . Claim: . The problem has optimal substructure $maxArea([1:n]) = max {a(1,n), maxArea([2:n]) }$. . Proof of Claim: . For the initial pair $(1,n)$ where, WLOG, $h(1) &lt; h(n)$ we have $a(1,n) &gt; a(1,i) forall k$. This is because we&#39;re starting out from the widest container formed by $(1,n)$ and considering containers of decreasing width formed by the pairs $(1, n-1), (1, n-2), ..., (1,2)$. In case $h(k) &gt; h(1)$ for some $1 &lt; k leq n$ the area of the container formed by $(1,k)$ is still determined by $h(1)$, except now it&#39;s less wide. Whereas if $h(k) &lt; h(1)$ the area of the container decreases not only in width but also in height. In both cases we have $a(1,n) &gt; a(1,k)$ which means in general $a(1,n) &gt; a(1, k) forall k$. Therefore, we may omit the first vertical line from consideration and consider the subproblem on the indices $2,...,n$. The overall optimal solution will then be $$maxArea([1:n]) = max {a(1,n), maxArea([2:n]) }$$ as claimed. . Inductive Proof . As with all problems that have a recursive substructure, an inductive proof of correctness is immediately what springs to mind. . Base Case: . For the case when $n = 2$, $maxArea([1:2]) = max {a(1,2), maxArea([2:2]) } = a(1,2)$ since $maxArea[2:2] = 0$. This is obviously correct. . Inductive Step: . Suppose for an array of length $m$, the procedure $maxArea$ is correct. We would like to show that for an array of length $m+1$ it is still correct. . Assume, WLOG, $h(1) &lt; h(m+1)$. Note that by the optimal substructure shown above, $maxArea([1:m+1]) = max {a(1,m+1), maxArea([2:m+1]) }$. In omiting the first element of the input array, the only pairs we remove from consideration are $(1,m), (1,m-1),..., (1,2)$ which we have previously shown to be suboptimal to $(1,m+1)$. And since by assumption the procedure $maxArea$ on the $m$-element subarray $[2:m+1]$ is correct, we are done! .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown.
