Thanks for dropping by! I'm Vahram, a software developer and graduate student of Computer Science @ [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). 

### 🎓 Education

After graduating from community college in 2018, I transfered to [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) where I pursued my undergraduate studies in Applied Mathematics. In 2020, having graduated from UCLA with honors, I enrolled in the M.S. in Computer Science program @ UT Austin.

### 💻 Work

While still at community college I got my first job as a Software Engineer Intern @ [Omron Automation](https://automation.omron.com/en/us/). There, I was part of the team that developed embedded systems for the motion controllers and control panels, as well as the team that built and maintained the company's proprietary Visual Studio based IDE.

In the Summer of 2022 I will be joining the team over @ [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) as a Software Engineer Intern.
