    "Linear programs are only a small subset of convex optimization problems but they're robust enough to model many real-life scenarios. For instance, even though they are continous optimization problems, their geometry (namely the fact that optimal solutions to an LP may occur only at the extreme points of the polyhedral constraint set) gives them a strong flavor of discrete optimization. This is why LPs are highly succesful at modelling problems that are inherently combinatorial — problems of scheduling, finding the shortest path, modelling a [discrete failures scenario](https://v-poghosyan.github.io/blog/optimization/combinatorics/applied%20mathematics/2022/02/09/Optimization-Robust-Linear-Programs-Modelling-Discrete-Failures.html), etc. \n",

Both of these cases are typically uninteresting in practice however they give important theoretical results. It's also useful to check whether or not a given LP is feasible and bounded before attempting to optimize. \n",
