    "## Classification vs. Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We start our discussion of decision trees with a definition of *classification* and *classifier*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Definition: &nbsp; **Classification** is the process of grouping data into discrete categories (i.e. **class labels**).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We may contrast this definition with *regression* which is the process of predicting a *continous* (i.e. real or complex-valued) output. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of a classification problem is the sorting of emails into the binary categories of *'spam'* and *'not spam'*. However, the labels in a classification problem need not be binary — they may be any discrete set. Whereas a common example of regression is learning a linear (or a non-linear) function that best fits a given dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The line between classification and regression is sometimes blurred. For instance, *logistic regression* is a regression algorithm which outputs a prediction in the continous probability range $[0,1]$. It's commonly used with a *decision rule* which casts its output into discrete classes. Thus, even though it's a regression algorithm, it can easily be converted into a classification algorithm and is often used for classification problems in practice.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the expected definition of a classifier, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Definition: &nbsp; A **classifier** is any algorithm that performs classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decision trees* are one type of classifier among many. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes of a decision tree correspond to the *features* of the dataset and its leaves correspond to the class labels. The paths in a decision tree corrspond to the *conjunction of features* that lead to the class labels at its leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, let's look at an example of a non-binary decision tree that's nonetheless very easy to understand because of the historical context of the data it's attempting to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "![](my_icons/decision-tree-example.jpg \"<br> Description: Decision tree that predicts the survival chances of the passangers in the Titanic.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The above decision tree has identified three features that best predict the chances of a given passanger of the Titanic to survive. These three features, in order of their effect on the accuracy of the prediction, are *gender*, *age*, and *sibsp* (which is the number of siblings or spouses).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can infer from the tree, were you a passanger on the Titanic, you would've likely survived if you were either female or a male child (below the age of 9.5) with less than 3 siblings (a conjunction of features)."

    "In the rest of this article, for simplicity, we will assume binary input and binary output for decision trees. That is, the training set is  ${S = \\{(x^1,y^1), ... ,(x^k, y^k)\\}}$ with ${x^i \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}$ and ${y^i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\ \\ \\forall i}$. This means that the decision tree itself is simply a binary function which also receives binary input. \n",
