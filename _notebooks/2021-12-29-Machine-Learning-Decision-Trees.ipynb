    "We start our discussion of decision trees with a definition of *classification* and *classifier*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Definition: **Classification** is the process of grouping data into discrete categories (i.e. **class labels**).\n",
    "\n",
    "We may contrast this definition with *regression* which is the process of predicting a *continous* (i.e. real or complex-valued) output. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of a classification problem is the sorting of emails into the binary categories of *'spam'* and *'not spam'*. However, the labels in a classification problem need not be binary — they may be any discrete set. Whereas a common example of regression is learning a linear (or a non-linear) function that best fits a given dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The line between classification and regression is sometimes blurred. For instance, *logistic regression* is a regression algorithm which outputs a prediction in the continous probability range $[0,1]$. It's commonly used with a *decision rule* which casts its output into discrete classes. Thus, even though it's a regression algorithm, it can easily be converted into a classification algorithm.\n",

    "> Definition: A **classifier** is any algorithm that performs classification.\n",

    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decision trees* are one type of classifier among many. In the following discussion, for simplicity, we assume binary input and binary output for decision trees. That is, the training set is  ${S = \\{(x^1,y^1), ... ,(x^k, y^k)\\}$ with $x^i \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ and $y^i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\ \\ \\forall i}$ and the decision tree itself is simply a binary function. The nodes of a decision tree correspond to the *features* of the input and its leaves corrspond to the class labels. Its paths corrspond to the *conjunction of features* that lead to the class labels at the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, let's look at an example of a non-binary decision tree that's nonetheles very simple to understand because of the historical context of the data. \n"
