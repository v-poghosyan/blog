    "Once again, since it's based on a NumPy array, a `Series` object also supports vectorization and broadcasted operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick reminder, *vectorization* is the process by which NumPy optimizes looping in Python. It stores the array internally in a contiguous block of memory and restricts its contents to only one data type. Letting Python know this data type in advance, NumPy can then skip the per-iteration type checking in order to speed up our code. In fact, NumPy delegates most of the operations on such optimized arrays to pre-written C code under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, *broadcasting* is the optimized process by which NumPy performs arithmetic and Boolean operations on arrays of unequal dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose the projected population growth of each G-7 country `10 mln` by the year 2030. Instead of looping through the `Series` object in a Pythonic way, adding `10` to each rowm we can simply use broadcasted addition.  "
