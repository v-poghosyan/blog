    "The basic unit of Pandas is the `pandas.Series` object which, on first siin keeping with the Excel analogy, can be thought of as a column in an Excel table. It's a one-dimensional data structure that's derived from a [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) array. However, unlike a Numpy array, the indices of a `Series` object aren't limited to the integer values $0,1,...n$ — they can be labels. \n",
