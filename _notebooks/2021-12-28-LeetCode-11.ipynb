    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]\n",
    "Output: 49\n",
    "Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreword\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force solution to this problem consists of checking each pair of vertical lines. Since order of any given pair does not matter, this solution has time complexity ${O({n \\choose 2}) = O(n^2)}$ where $n$ is the length of the `height` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-brute-force solution to this problem (i.e. the 'two pointer solution') is pretty intuitive -  the difficulty lies in its proof of correctness. Therefore, I will give away the procedure in this foreword and then proceed to prove its correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the overall procedure in words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize left and right pointers at 1 and n respectively (assuming indices start at 1).\n",
    "- While the pointers do not intersect:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Fix the pointer whose corresponding vertical line is longer. \n",
    "   - Advance the pointer whose corresponding vertical line is shorter towards the fixed one.\n",

    "## Optimal Substructure\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is inspired by the following recurisve [optimal substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20problem,greedy%20algorithms%20for%20a%20problem.) of the problem:\n",

    "- Let $h(i)$ denote the height of the $i$-th vertical line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $a(i,j)$ denote the area of the container formed by the pair of vertical lines $(i,j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $maxArea([i:j])$ denote the maximum area formed by the lines ${i,...,j}$ – that is the output of the procedure on the subarray ${[i:j]}$. \n",

    "The problem has optimal substructure: \n",
    "$$maxArea([1:n]) = max\\{a(1,n), maxArea([2:n])\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Claim\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial pair $(1,n)$ where, *WLOG*, ${h(1) < h(n)}$ we have ${a(1,n) > a(1,k)  \\ \\ \\forall k}$. This is because we're starting out from the *widest container* formed by ${(1,n)}$ and considering containers of decreasing width formed by the pairs ${(1, n-1), (1, n-2), ..., (1,2)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "In case ${h(k) > h(1)}$ for some ${1 < k \\leq n}$ the area of the container formed by ${(1,k)}$ is still determined by ${h(1)}$, except now it's less wide. Whereas if ${h(k) < h(1)}$ the area of the container decreases not only in width but also in height. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases we have ${a(1,n) > a(1,k)}$ which means in general ${a(1,n) > a(1, k) \\ \\ \\forall k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we may omit the first vertical line from consideration and consider the subproblem on the indices ${2,...,n}$. The overall optimal solution will then be $$maxArea([1:n]) = max\\{a(1,n), maxArea([2:n])\\}$$\n",

    "## Inductive Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all problems that have a recursive optimal substructure, an inductive proof of correctness is immediately what springs to mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base Case\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case when $n = 2$, ${maxArea([1:2]) = max\\{a(1,2), maxArea([2:2])\\} = a(1,2)}$ since ${maxArea[2:2] = 0}$. This is obviously correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inductive Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose for an array of length $m$, the procedure $maxArea$ is correct. We would like to show that for an array of length $m+1$ it is still correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume, *WLOG*, ${h(1) < h(m+1)}$.\n",
    "Note that by the optimal substructure shown above, ${maxArea([1:m+1]) = max\\{a(1,m+1), maxArea([2:m+1])\\}}$. In omiting the first element of the input array, the only pairs we remove from consideration are ${(1,m), (1,m-1),..., (1,2)}$ which we have already shown to be suboptimal to ${(1,m+1)}$ in the proof of the optimal substructure. And since by assumption the procedure $maxArea$ on the $m$-element subarray ${[2:m+1]}$ is correct, we are done! "
