    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]\n",
    "Output: 49\n",
    "Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreword\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force solution to this problem consists of checking each pair of vertical lines. Since order of the pair does not matter, this solution has time complexity $O(n \\choose 2) = O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-brute-force solution to this problem (i.e. the 'two pointer solution') is pretty intuitive -  the difficulty lies in its proof of correctness. Therefore, I will give away the solution in this foreword and then proceeed to prove its correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize left and right pointers as `lpt = 1` and `rpt = n` respectively. \n"
