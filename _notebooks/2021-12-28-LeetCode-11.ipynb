    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]\n",
    "Output: 49\n",
    "Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreword\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force solution to this problem consists of checking each pair of vertical lines. Since order of any given pair does not matter, this solution has time complexity $O({n \\choose 2}) = O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the length of the `height` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-brute-force solution to this problem (i.e. the 'two pointer solution') is pretty intuitive -  the difficulty lies in its proof of correctness. Therefore, I will give away the procedure in this foreword and then proceeed to prove its correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's the procedure:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize left and right pointers at 1 and n respectively (assuming indexing starting at 1).\n",
    "2. While the pointers do not intersect:\n",
    "    - Fix the pointer whose corresponding vertical line is longer. \n",
    "    - Advance the pointer whose corresponding vertical line is shorter towards the fixed one."

    "The procedure is inspired by the following recursive property of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $h(i)$ denote the height of the $i$-th vertical line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $v(i,j)$ denote the volume of the container formed by the pair of vertical lines $(i,j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial pair $(1,n)$ where, *WLOG*, $h(1) < h(n)$ we have $v(1,n) > v(1,i)  \\ \\ \\forall i$. This is because we're starting out from the *widest container* formed by $(1,n)$ and considering containers of decreasing width formed by the pairs $(1, n-1), (1, n-2), ..., (1,2)$. In case $h(k) > h(1)$ for some $1 < k \\leq n$ the volume of the container formed by $(1,k)$ is still determined by $h(1)$, except now it's less wide. Whereas if $h(k) < h(1)$ the volume of the container decreases not only in width but also in height. In both cases we have $v(1,n) > v(1,k)$ which means in general $v(1,n) > v(1, i) \\ \\ \\forall i$. Therefore, we may omit the first vertical line from consideration and consider the subproblem on the indices $2,...,n$.   "
