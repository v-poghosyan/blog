    "The study of optimization can be summed up as the attempt to find those parameter(s) that optimize some objective function, if such exist. The objective function can be almost anything — cost, profit, nodes in a wireless network, distance to a destination, similarity to a target image, etc. If the objective function describes cost we may wish to minimize it. If, on the other hand, it describes profit then a natural goal would be to maximize it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problems of minimization and maximization, summed up as *optimization* in one word, are the same problem up to a reflection with respect to the domain of the parameter(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, let the objective function be $f: \\mathbb{R^n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and let it have minimizer $x^* \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$. Then, by definition of minimizer, $f(x^*) \\leq f(x) \\ \\ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$. It follows that $-f(x^*) \\geq -f(x) \\ \\ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$, so $x^*$ is the maximizer for $-f$.\n",

    "## Why Convex Optimization?\n",

    "First, let's define the *size* of an optimization problem as the dimensionality of the parameter $x$ added to the number of the problem constraints.\n",

    "These problems are general enough to capture many scenarios of interest, even some that do not fall strictly into the convex category, but specific enough to be solvable through generic algorithms and numerical methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "An *intersection* of convex sets is also convex. That is, $C' = \\{ x \\ | \\ x \\in C_1 \\cap x \\in C_2 \\}$ is convex provided that $C_1$ and $C_2$ were convex to begin with. The proof follows directly from the definition of intersection...\n",
