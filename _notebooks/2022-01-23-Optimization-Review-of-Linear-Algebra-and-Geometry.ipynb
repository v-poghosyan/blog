    "The study of optimization can be summed up as the attempt to find those parameter(s) that optimize some objective function, if such exist. The objective function can be almost anything — cost, profit, nodes in a wireless network, distance to a destination, similarity to a target image, etc. If the objective function describes cost we may wish to minimize it. If, on the other hand, it describes profit then a natural goal would be to maximize it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problems of minimization and maximization, summed up as *optimization* in one word, are the same problem up to a reflection with respect to the domain of the parameter(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, let the objective function be $f: \\mathbb{R^n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and let it have minimizer $x^* \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$. Then, by definition of minimizer, $f(x^*) \\leq f(x) \\ \\ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$. It follows that $-f(x^*) \\geq -f(x) \\ \\ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$, so $x^*$ is the maximizer for $-f$.\n",

    "\n",
    "An *intersection* of convex sets is also convex. That is, $C' = \\{ x \\ | \\ x \\in C_1 \\cap x \\in C_2 \\}$ is convex provided that $C_1$ and $C_2$ were convex to begin with. The proof follows directly from the definition of intersection...\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$ be $n$ points in space. Their *convex hull* is the set of all points which can be written as some convex combination of them. Equivalently, by varying the $theta_i$'s we generate the convex hull as the set of all convex combinations of these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convex hull (i.e. set of all convex combinations) of two points is the line segment joining them. That of three points is the polygon (complete with the region it bounds). In general, for $n$ points, the concept generalizes to a convex hull.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, $\\textrm{Convex Hull} = \\{ \\theta_1 x_1 + ... + \\theta_n x_n \\ | \\ \\theta_1 + ... + \\theta_n = 1 \\ \\ \\textrm{and} \\ \\ \\theta_i \\geq 0 \\ \\ \\forall i \\}$\n",

    "The convex hull can be visualized as the closed polygon formed when a rubber band is stretched around the $n$ points. \n",

    "### Convex Hull of a Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The convex hull of a set can be similarly defined as all the convex combinations of the elements in the set. However, since the set may contain infinite elements, there's a more helpful, equivalent definition...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $C$ be a non-convex set. The convex hull of $C$ is the intersection of all convex supersets of $C$. That is, it's the intersection of all convex sets containing $C$. The result of such an intersection will be the smallest convex superset of $C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this minimal convex superset is unique {% fn 1 %} and can therefore be taken as yet another, equivalent, definition for the convex hull of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing the convex hull of a non-convex set is similar to visualizing that of $n$ points — simply imagine the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around the non-convex set.\n",

    "\n",
    "For two points, the set of all affine combinations is the *line* that passes through them, whereas for three points it's the *plane*. in general, it is the plane in $(n-1)$-dimensions passing through the $n$ points.\n",

    "### Hyperplanes and Halfspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A *linear combination* of $n$ points is all points of the form $x = \\theta_1 x_1 + ... + \\theta_n x_n$ with the $\\theta_i$'s totally unrestricted. \n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all linear combinations of a point, i.e. its *span*, is the line passing through it. for two points, the span is the plane passing through them. In general, the span of $n$ points is a plane in $n$-dimensions that contains these points.\n",

    "#### Hyperplanes\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fixed linear combination, that is for fixed weights $\\theta_i = a_i \\ \\ \\forall i$, a *hyperplane* is the set of all points $x \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$ whose fixed linear combination equals a fixed constant $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, $\\textrm{Hyperplane} = \\{ x \\ \\ | \\ \\ a_1 x_1 + ... a_n x_n = b\\} = \\{ x \\ \\ | \\ \\ a^T x = b\\}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a geometric interpretation to the parameters $a \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since the dot-product between perpendicular vectors is $0$, $\\{ x \\ \\ | \\ \\  a^T x = 0\\}$ is simply the set of all vectors perpendicuar to $a$ (the tail of which, as with all vectors in Linear Algebra, is considered to be fixed at the origin), making $a$ the *normal vector* to the hyperplane passing through the origin. To allow for parallel hyperplanes that are translated from the origin, the *offset* $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is introduced in the generalization $\\{ x \\ \\ | \\ \\ a^T x = b \\}$. This is now the set of all vectors whose dot-product with $a$ is constant. These vectors are not quite perpendicular to $a$, but they form the hyperplane that's shifted from the origin by a distance $\\frac{|b|}{\\|a\\|_2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: A hyperplane is, of course, a span. But, rather than being a span of $x_1, ..., x_n$, it's the span of $a_1, ..., a_n$ in the weights $x_1, ..., x_n$.\n",
