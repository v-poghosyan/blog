    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every linear program, and every optimization problem in general, has a closely related problem called its dual which can be colloquially thought of as its evil twin. The primal and the dual represent two different perspectives on the same problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the most general case, if the primal is a minimization problem, its  dual is a maximization problem. In the case of constrained optimization, if the primal is minimization in $n$ variables and $m$ constraints, its dual is a maximization in $m$ variables and $n$ constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, any value attained by the dual problem is a lower bound of all the values attained by the primal and, in particular, the primal optimal value. This property, called *Weak Duality*, is at the core of duality. Deriving a dual that obtains, at the very least, a useful lower bound to the primal optimal value is one of the nascent ideas behind *Duality Theory*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of problems which exhibit *Strong Duality*, such as linear programs and most convex non-linear optimization problems, the primal and the dual optima are strictly equal. That is, solving the dual guarantees that we've also solved the primal. Furthermore, since taking the dual of the dual gives back the primal, this relationship is true in the converse — if we've solved the primal then we've also solved its dual.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes Duality Theory useful in practice. Having a related, possibly easier, optimization problem gives applied scientists a huge computational advantage. Even if the dual does not turn out to be easier to solve and/or Strong Duality does not hold, we still stand to gain structural insight about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will show how to form the dual of a problem, examine its relationship with the primal in detail, and list possible primal-dual outcomes. In doing so, we will look at duality in the general case of constrained optimization problems, in a specific type of unconstrained problem, and in linear programs."

    "As we shall see later, certain types of unconstrained problems have duals which arise from the [Fenchel-Legendre Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate). However, in constrained problems, it is the constraints themselves which give rise to duality through the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_relaxation).  \n",

    "Take the most general form of constrained problem with $m$ inequality and $n$ equality constraints and assume nothing, as of yet, about its convexity. To make the discussion interesting, assume the problem is non-trivial (i.e. its constraint set is non-empty and contains more than one feasible point). Furthermore, so that we may have a solution to speak of, assume the problem is bounded with the finite optimal value of $f_0(x^*)$ for some optimizer $x^*$."

On the other hand, if a primal constraint is *tight* at $x^*$, Complementary Slackness tells us nothing about its corresponding dual variable. \n",

Hence, the constraint corresponding to $\\lambda^*_i$ must be tight. Otherwise $x^*$ is not optimal, and a better solution can be found by making the non-binding constraint binding. \n",
    "\n",

    "# Theorems of the Alternative\n",

    "As mentioned earlier, these are theorems that describe exclusively disjoint scenarios that together comprise the entire outcome space. Formally, these are theorems of the form $A \\implies \\neg B \\land \\neg A \\implies  B$  where $A$, and $B$ are logical statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that theorems of equivalence (i.e. theorems of the form *'the following are equivalent - TFAE'*) can also be formulated as theorems of the alternative. To say that $A$ and $B$ are equivalent means $ A \\iff B$. But this breaks down as $A \\implies B \\land B \\implies A$. Letting $\\hat B = \\neg B$ we can rewrite the above as $A \\implies \\neg \\hat B \\land B \\implies A$. But, by taking the contrapositive, $B \\implies A$ becomes $\\neg A \\implies \\neg B$, which is to say $\\neg A \\implies \\hat B$. In summary, we have shown that $A \\iff B$ is equivalent to $A \\implies \\neg \\hat B \\land \\neg A \\implies \\hat B$.\n",

    "### Using a Separation Argument\n",

    "> **Separating Hyperplane Theorem:** For any convex set $C$, if a point $\\omega \\notin C$ then there exists a hyperplane separating $\\omega$ and $C$.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Farkas' Lemma, for instance, is proved by a separation argument that uses, as its convex set, the conic combination of the $a_i$'s. The conclusion is immediate since in Farkas' Lemma the first statement plainly says that a vector belongs to the convex set, and the second statement plainly says there exists a separating hyperplane between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the pattern all separation arguments must follow. However, in general, it may take a bit of work to define the problem-specific convex set and also to show that the two statements are *really* talking about belonging to this set, and separation from it. However, once these three things are accomplished the proof is complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this idea, let's give a proof of the above theorem of the alternative using a separation argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "First order of business is to come up with a convex set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take $C = \\{ z : z = Ay, \\sum_i y_i = 1, y \\geq 0 \\}$ to be the convex hull of the columns of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first statement in the theorem was that $\\exists x \\ne 0$ s.t. $Ax = 0$ and $x \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $x \\ne 0$ and $x \\geq 0$ we can scale as $x$ as $y = \\alpha x$ until $\\sum_i y_i = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first statement is equivalent to saying the origin belongs to the convex hull $C$ (i.e. $0 \\in C$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second statement was that $\\exists p$ s.t. $p^TA > 0$. This is equivalent to saying that all the columns of $A$ lie to one side of the separating hyperplane introduced by $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all $z \\in C$ are convex combinations of $A$'s columns. In particular since they're a convex combination they're also a conic combination, so all $z \\in C$ also lie on the same side of the hyperplane. That is $p^Tz > 0 \\ \\ \\forall z \\in C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, of course, $p^T0 = 0$ (not $> 0$). So, according to the second statement, the origin is separated from $C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the proof since the two statements must be mutually exclusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Strong Duality\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong duality isn't just a tool for applied science, it has important theoretical uses. For instance, now that we've proven it we can use Strong Duality, instead of a separation argument, to prove theorems of the alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it gives us feasibility of two different constraint sets, it makes sense to use duality to prove theorems of existence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the aforementioned theorem of the alternative for example...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove the theorem we need to show two things. First, we need to show $1 \\implies \\neg 2$, then we need to show $\\neg 1 \\implies 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $1 \\implies \\neg 2$ direction is simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\exists x \\ne 0$ s.t. $Ax = 0$ and $x \\geq 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then $\\forall p \\ \\ (p^TA)x = p^T(Ax) = p^T0 = 0$ (not $> 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We tackle the $\\neg 1 \\implies 2$ direction using duality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy is to construct a linear program based on $\\neg 1$ such that the feasibility of its dual implies $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can express $\\neg 1$ as '$\\forall x \\ne 0$, either $Ax \\ne 0$ or $x < 0$.' Equivalently, '$x \\ne 0 \\implies Ax \\ne 0$ or $x < 0$.' Taking the contrapositive, statement $1$ becomes '$Ax = 0$ and  $x \\geq 0 \\implies x = 0$.' \n",
