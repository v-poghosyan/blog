    "We are faced with the task of modelling a scenario in which at most $k$ of the total $n$ workers, machines, sensors, or other system components can fail. The task is to minimize the amount of system components need, thereby minimizing cost, subject to certain known and robust constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume the linear cost function to be $c^Tx$, and the known constraints to be $Ax \\leq b$. The robust constraint is $a_R^Tx \\leq b_R, \\ \\ \\forall a_R \\in D_k$ where $b_R$ is a known vector, and $D_k$ is the following interval uncertainty set with an additional combinatorial constraint: \n",
    "\n",
    "$D_k = \\{ a : a_i \\in [\\hat a_i - \\delta_i, \\hat a_i + \\delta_i] \\wedge \\textrm{at least $n-k$ of the $a_i$'s exactly equal $\\hat a_i$}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In $D_k$, we can think of each $\\hat a_i$ as the spec at which the $i$-th component should operate, and the $\\delta_i$'s as the $i$-th component's deviation from this spec. Thus, $D_k$ models the discrete failures scenario exactly...\n",

    "Let's attempt to formulate this problem as a robust LP in the standard form.\n",
