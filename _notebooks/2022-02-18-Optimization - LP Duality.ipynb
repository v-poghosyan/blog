    "Every linear program (a primal) has a closely related linear program called its dual which can be thought of as its evil twin. If the primal LP is a minimization problem in $n$ variables and $m$ constraints, then its dual is a maximization problem in $m$ variables and $n$ constraints. In this post, we will closely examine the nature of the relationship between the primal and the dual. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that the key relationship between the primal and the dual is the fact that the dual's optimal value agrees with that of the primal. So, solving the dual guarantees that we've also solved the primal. Furthermore, as we shall see, taking the dual of the dual gives back the primal, so this relationship is a two way street. That is, if we've solved the primal then we've also solved the dual. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes [duality theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(optimization)) so useful in practice. To have a related, possibly easier, problem for a given optimization problem for free is a huge benefit. Even if the dual does not turn out to be easier to solve, it still has the potential to shed some light on the structure of the primal problem due to the various theoretical ties between the two."

    "In the case of primal-dual optimal points $(x^*, p^*)$, weak duality states $b^Tp^* \\geq c^Tx^*$. This is simply a restatement of the [max-min inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max%E2%80%93min_inequality) within the context of LP's. \n",

    "$$\n",

    "Since no assumption on $f$ is made, the max-min inequality certainly also applies to the special case of linear objective functions of LP's. And since we're in the special case where the optima are assumed to exist, the functions attain their optima. That is, we can replace $\\sup$ and $\\inf$ in the max-min inequality with $\\max$ and $\\min$.\n",

Suppose, per the rules of the game, player $A$ has the first turn. Then player $B$'s choice is final and it restricts the actions player $A$ can take. So player $B$ has an advantage in this game. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the first game player $A$ is restricted to choosing $x$ that will minimize $s_1(x) = \\max_y f(x,y)$. Consequently, the payoff in the first game will be $ s_1 = \\min_x \\left\\{ \\max_y f(x,y) \\right\\}$. \n",
