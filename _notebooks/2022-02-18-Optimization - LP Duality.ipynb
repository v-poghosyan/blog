    "Every linear program (a primal) has a closely related linear program called its dual which can be thought of as its evil twin. If the primal LP is a minimization problem in $n$ variables and $m$ constraints, then its dual is a maximization problem in $m$ variables and $n$ constraints. In this post, we will closely examine the nature of the relationship between the primal and the dual. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that the key relationship between the primal and the dual is the fact that the dual's optimal value agrees with that of the primal. So, solving the dual guarantees that we've also solved the primal. Furthermore, as we shall see, taking the dual of the dual gives back the primal, so this relationship is a two way street. That is, if we've solved the primal then we've also solved the dual. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes Duality Theory so useful in practice. To have a related, possibly easier, problem for a given optimization problem for free is a huge benefit. Even if the dual does not turn out to be easier to solve, it still has the potential to shed some light on the structure of the primal problem due to the various theoretical ties between the two."
