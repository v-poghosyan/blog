    "Every convex optimization problem has a closely related problem called its *dual* which can be colloquially thought of as its evil twin. The primal and the dual represent two different perspectives on the same problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the most general case, if the primal is a minimization problem, its dual is a maximization problem. In the case of constrained optimization, if the primal is minimization in $n$ variables and $m$ constraints, its dual is a maximization in $m$ variables and $n$ constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, any feasible value of the dual's objective is a lower-bound of all the feasible values of the primal's objective. In particular, should they both exist, the dual optimal is a lower bound on the primal optimal. This property, called *Weak Duality*, is at the core of duality. Deriving a dual problem that obtains, at the very least, a useful lower bound to the primal's optimal is one of the nascent ideas behind *Duality Theory*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of problems which exhibit *Strong Duality*, such as linear programs and a certain category of convex non-linear optimization problems, the primal and the dual optima are strictly equal to each other. That is, solving the dual guarantees that we've also solved the primal. Furthermore, since taking the dual of the dual gives back the primal, this relationship is true in the converse — if we've solved the primal then we've also solved its dual.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes Duality Theory so useful in practice. Having a related, possibly easier, optimization problem gives applied scientists a huge computational advantage. However, even if the dual does not turn out to be easier to solve and/or Strong Duality does not hold, we still stand to gain structural insight about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we will show how to form the dual of a problem, examine, in detail, its relationship with the primal, and list all possible primal-dual outcomes. In doing so, we will look at duality in the general case of constrained optimization problems, in a type of unconstrained problem, as well as in linear programs."

In a sense, constraints are what give rise to duality through the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_relaxation). As we shall see later, certain types of unconstrained problems also have duals which arise from dummy constraints, or directly through the [Fenchel-Legendre Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the most general form of constrained problem with $m$ inequality and $n$ equality constraints and assume nothing, as of yet, about its convexity. To make the discussion interesting, assume the problem is non-trivial (i.e. its constraint set is non-empty and contains more than one feasible point). Furthermore, so that we may have a solution to speak of, assume the problem is bounded with the finite optimal value of $f_0(x^*)$ for some optimizer $x^*$."

    "# The Dual of an Unconstrained Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned briefly, in the case of certain types of unconstrained problems, the Fenchel-Legendre (FL) Transform is what gives rise to the dual. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the FL Transform which is also known as a *Convex Conjugate* for reasons that will soon become apparent. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "> **FL Transform / Convex Conjugate:** &nbsp; The *FL Transform* or *Convex Conjugate* of a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is: \n",
    "$$f^*(y) = \\sup_x \\left\\{y^Tx - f(x)\\right\\}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We note some key properties of the FL Transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FL Transform - a Convex Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The FL Transform $f^*$ is always convex regardless of the convexity of $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's because, for a fixed $x$, $y^Tx - f(x)$ is a linear function in $y$. So, $f^*$ is a point-wise supremum of linear functions, making it convex. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Case of Involution\n",
    "\n",
    "The double FL Transform $f^{**}$ does not always recover $f$. To see this, note that, as an FL Transform of the function $f^*$, $f^{**}$ is always convex. Therefore, $f^{**} \\ne f$ if $f$ is non-convex. \n",
    "\n",
    "But convexity alone is not enough to guarantee involution. We need an additional condition on $f$, namely that its sub-level sets must be closed, to ensure $f^{**} = f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inverse Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f$ has closed sub-level sets and is convex then the gradients of $f$ and $f^*$ are inverses. That is, assuming both $f$ and $f^*$ are differentiable:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$y = \\nabla f(x) \\iff x = \\nabla f^*(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's prove the $\\implies$ direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $y = \\nabla f(x)$. By $f$'s convexity: \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$f(\\hat x) \\geq f(x) + y^T(\\hat x - x) \\ \\ \\forall \\hat x$$\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "$$y^T \\hat x - f(\\hat x) \\leq y^T x - f(x) \\ \\ \\forall \\hat x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking supremum over $x$ and by noting that, since the sub-level sets are closed, the supremum is attained, we obtain:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$f^*(y) = y^T x - f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired result follows by taking the gradient of both sides w.r.t. $y$. That is:\n",

    "$$\\nabla f^*(y) = x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\impliedby$ direction is similar. We start from the assumption that $x = \\nabla f^*(y)$ and get the desired result by using the involution property $f^{**} = f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## FL Duality\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the FL Transform has a natural role in duality.\n",

    "$$\\mathcal{L}(x,y,z) = f(x) + h(y) + z^T(Ax - y)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "But all $z \\in C$ are convex combinations of $A$'s columns. In particular since they're a convex combination they're also a conic combination, so all $z \\in C$ also lie on the same side of the hyperplane. That is $p^Tz > 0 \\ \\ \\forall z \\in C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, of course, $p^T0 = 0$ (not $> 0$). So, according to the second statement, the origin is separated from $C$. \n",
