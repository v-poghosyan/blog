Hi, my name is Vahram and I'm a software developer based in sunny Los Angeles, CA 📍

This blog is where I write about things that interests me, such as Machine Learning, Data Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and various other topics. 
I started it in 2021 from some notes I took in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). From there it was only a small effort to publish them via [Fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) 
which is a blogging platform built on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and which relies on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. 

My intent with this blog is to post short articles about things I've learned on the job or during my spare time for my future-self to remember and for the benefit of 
others. It will serve as a centralized hub for my notes and ideas on the web.
