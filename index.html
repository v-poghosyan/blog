Hi, welcome to my blog where I write about topics that interests me: Machine Learning, Data Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and various other things. 
I started this blog in 2021 from some notes I took in Jupyter notebooks. From this starting point, it was only a small effort to publish them via Fastpages which is 
a blogging platform built on top of Jekyll with hosting on GitHub Pages. 

My intent with this blog is to keep posting short articles about things I learned on the job or during my spare time.
