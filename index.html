Hi, my name is Vahram. I'm a Software Developer and graduate student of Computer Science based in Los Angeles, CA 📍

This blog is where I write about the subjects that interests me, such as various topics in Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning, Data Science, as well as Computer Science and Software Engineering. It's where I collect my notes and ideas on the web.
I started the blog in late 2021 from some notes I took in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). From there it was only a small effort to publish them via [Fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), a blogging platform powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
